# Monad Testnet Auto Python Bot

This repository contains a collection of Python scripts designed to automate various tasks on the Monad Testnet, including staking, swapping, deploying contracts, and sending transactions. The scripts are integrated with a central `main.py` file for easy navigation and execution, supporting multiple private keys and a user-friendly CLI interface.

## Setup Instructions:

- Python 3.7 or higher (recommended 3.9 or 3.10 due to `asyncio` usage).
- `pip` (Python package installer)

## Installation
1. **Clone this repository:**
- Open cmd or Shell, then run the command:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/ytbiilly/Monad-Testnet-Auto-Python-Bot.git
```
```sh
cd Monad-Testnet-Auto-Python-Bot
```
2. **Install Dependencies:**
- Open cmd or Shell, then run the command:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. **Prepare Input Files:**
- Open the `pvkey.txt`: Add your private keys (one per line) in the root directory.
```sh
nano pvkey.txt 
```
- Open the `address.txt`(optional): Add recipient addresses (one per line) for `sendtx.py`.
```sh
nano address.txt 
```
4. **Run:**
- Open cmd or Shell, then run command:
```sh
python main.py
```
